We're going to add a few more concepts.

Let's look at the history of the project:

Now it may be natural to ask: **Can we go back to a previous point in the timeline?**\ 
Or, in other words, can we load the files and folders from a previous commit into our file system.

The answer is yes. But first we must understand a little bit more theory.

You will notice we have `main` in this diagram. `main` is a **branch** - and this branch you can think of as a reference to a particular commit.\
In other words, the `main` branch acts like an arrow that points to a particular commit.

🔑 A branch is a pointer to a particular commit.

So we say that `main` is a reference to the commit
