# Git workshop

Preview me!

This workshop serves several purposes:

- Build a strong **mental model** for Git
- Consolidate existing knowledge of Git
- Practice use of CLI skills for Git


## Learning objects

After this session, learners should be able to:


- *Define* the working tree
- *List* a subset of files and directories in a working directory according to some criteria
- *Define* a git commit
- *List* the different versions of a Git project
- *Identify* the metadata for an arbitrary commit in a timeline
- *Checkout* the files and folders in a given commit
- *Define* the staging area
- *Explain* the purpose of the staging area 
- *Add* changes in the working directory to the staging area using an appropriate Git porcelain command
- *Explain* the difference between `git commit` and `git add`
- *Create* a new feature branch using the Git porcelain commands
- *Switch* between branches in a Git project using Git porcelain commands 

You'll need to work on this project in pairs.

- You can assign one person to be "Person 1"
- You can assign another person to be "Person 2"

## Setup

Person 1 will need to **clone down this repo**. Keep it on your machine. Person 1 you're in charge of reading the instructions in this repo. You'll need to start at `0-working-directory.md`

Person 2 will need to clone down another repository (we'll be answering questions about this repo during this workshop)

❗ Whenever Person 1 reads out instructions, they'll be asking Person 2 to run those commands on their machine, in the repo they cloned down to their machine.

Person 1 will be prompted to read something out when they encounter this symbol: 📚 🗣️
When you encounter ❓ then you can answer the questions. Just update the markdown files as you go along.
This workshop is designed to be a bit tricky and mysterious on purpose: but hopefully you'll undergo a journey of discovery as you work through these resources!
