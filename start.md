# Git workshop

Preview me!

This workshop serves several purposes:

- Build a strong **mental model** for Git
- Consolidate existing knowledge of Git
- Practice use of CLI skills for Git

You'll need to work on this project in pairs.

- You can assign one person to be "Person 1"
- You can assign another person to be "Person 2"

## Setup

Person 1 will need to **clone down this repo**. Keep it on your machine. Person 1 you're in charge of reading the instructions in this repo. You'll need to start at `0-working-directory.md`

Person 2 will need to clone down another repository (we'll be answering questions about this repo during this workshop)

❗ Whenever Person 1 reads out instructions, they'll be asking Person 2 to run those commands on their machine, in the repo they cloned down to their machine.

Person 1 will be prompted to read something out when they encounter this symbol: 📚 🗣️
When you encounter ❓ then you can answer the questions. Just update the markdown files as you go along.
This workshop is designed to be a bit tricky and mysterious on purpose: but hopefully you'll undergo a journey of discovery as you work through these resources!
